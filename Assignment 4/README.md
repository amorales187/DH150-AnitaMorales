# DH 150: Assignment 4 
## Contextual Inquiry (CI) for the LA County Library Website 

Initially, I aimed to focus on improving the whole website expereince for library users. Since LA County Library's website incorporates several features and functions, I decided to narrow my scope and focus on improving the user's expereince when using the library catalog. 

## Design Challenge 

How might I design an accessible and efficient library catalog for middle-age women?

Over the summer of 2020, the LA County Library began using Enterprise for their catalogue. Just previous to changing their vendor, they redesigned their website. Many library patrons were not happy with these changes and are finding the new catalog "too complex". Additionally, the catalogue is not as accessible or easy to use. 

My project aims to adjust the LA County Library's website to make the catalogue more accessible and efficient. 

## Target Users

With the new website design and new catalog, I want to focus on how middle aged women are using the LA County Library's website. I aim to design a website that allows my target audience to better discover and use the library's catalogue.

## Research Methods

The research methods I implemeneted in my CI were particpatory and observational. Due to the current status of the pandemic, I decided to interview my mom who fit my target audience. In my interview, I had her complete an activity: use the LA County Library's online catalogue. I also asked her background and follow-up questions on her experience with the library's online catalogue.

## Insights from the interview

  * *Using the catalogue is not commnly used//7:20*
> "probably looking for books, it's not as predominantly as you would want it I guess."

 * *Location of Availibility is something of interest//12:52*
> "maybe what I would have wanted would be to have actually an option where I could go ahead and enter the title, where I'm looking for the book, and I think it might allow me to honestly I didn't check for that at the moment, in the sense that I can select, specifically the library that I want to search at show."
