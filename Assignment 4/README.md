# DH 150: Assignment 4 
## Contextual Inquiry (CI) for the LA County Library Website 

Initially, I aimed to focus on improving the whole website expereince for library users. Since LA County Library's website incorporates several features and functions, I decided to narrow my scope and focus on improving the user's expereince when using the library catalog. 

## Design Challenge 

How might I design an accessible and efficient library catalog for middle-age women?

Over the summer of 2020, the LA County Library began using Enterprise for their catalogue. Just previous to changing their vendor, they redesigned their website. Many library patrons were not happy with these changes and are finding the new catalog "too complex". Additionally, the catalogue is not as accessible or easy to use. 

My project aims to adjust the LA County Library's website to make the catalogue more accessible and efficient. 

## Target Users

With the new website design and new catalog, I want to focus on how middle aged women are using the LA County Library's website. I aim to design a website that allows my target audience to better discover and use the library's catalogue.

## Research Methods

The research methods I implemeneted in my CI were particpatory and observational. Due to the current status of the pandemic, I decided to interview my mom who fit my target audience. In my interview, I had her complete an activity: use the LA County Library's online catalogue. I also asked her background and follow-up questions on her experience with the library's online catalogue.


## Interview Guide

Before conducting the interview, I outlined some questions in [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFatGOJKOdNUX3XIK9M5PvioICvRzjMBdtj4hIy0yRw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Insights from the interview

  * *Using the catalogue is not commnly used // 7:20*
> "probably looking for books, it's not as predominantly as you would want it I guess."

 * *Location of Availibility is something of interest // 12:52*
> "maybe what I would have wanted would be to have actually an option where I could go ahead and enter the title, where I'm looking for the book, and I think it might allow me to honestly I didn't check for that at the moment, in the sense that I can select, specifically the library that I want to search at show."



## Reflection

Compared to the creating activities and questions for User Testing, I found it more difficult to create a transcript and plan questions for a Contextual Inquiry. Initially, I aimed to focus on improving the overall design of the LA County Library's website. When conducting the Heuristic Evaluation and completing a user test, I found several minor and significant improvements to be done; however, it was difficult to frame my CI around all these improvements. 

Going into my CI, I expected that library patrons are less likely to search for library resources when using the website. In the CI, looking for books and using the catalogue are less likely to be used, at least by my participant. Conducting the CI, allowed me to gain more insight on the website and how troubling it is to find and use the catalogue since it changing to Enterprise. It also provided me with user expectations and journey when 1)finding the catalogue 2)using the catalogue 3)placing a hold. 

Next time, I will go into the CI with a narrow scope and activity for my participant. This will allow me to develop better background questions based on that activity to be done.
