# DH150 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing by Anita Morales
## Introduction

**LA County Library** is the largest library system in California and serves communities along its 86 branches. They created a website to promote their resources and services. On the website, patrons can use the catalog to find books and can also manage their check outs through the website. The LA County Library offers several e-resources, such as Mango and Kanopy, that provides patrons with access of information and learning from home. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing (UT)
The purpose of a usability test is to test and improve how easy a user interface is to use and navigate. With UT Testing, designers are able to identify specific problems and expand results from a heuristic evaulation. Further, UT Tests allow designers to determine how effective, efficient, and satisfactory a product is to the users. 

## Methodology

In this UT session, I used Apowersoft Online Screen Recorder to record my user interview in a quiet room. I went ahead and interviewed my mom since she fit my target audience; middle age woman between the ages of 45-60. The entire process took about 35 minutes. 

This User Test focused on testing three heaurstitics in order to design three different tasks. Each tasks measured the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product for the user. 

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Aesthetic and minimalist design | Cluttered and overwhelming homepage | Find an online resource (BrainFuse)  | 
Match between system and real world   | List of closest libraries are not listed after search | Locate a local branch (La Puente) |
Flexibility and efficiency of use | Catalog iso verwhelming and lacks flexibility  | Find a book in the catalog |

**Process of the Usability Test:**
* Introduction
* Informed Consent
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* (3) Task Scenarios 
* Post-Test Questionnaire
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

## Reflection
Generally, the UT went smoothly with some minor problems that could have made the process a little better. The first is the two disturbances from my mom coming into the room, which I should have informed her about beforehand. The second is my patience being tested because the participant was not as vocal as I’d like her to be so I found the tone of my voice just a bit harsh. The awareness that she was being recorded probably made her conscious so I should be more considerate when it comes to participants who are less vocal. Also, my sister probably was not the best user to test since I would not consider her a target audience for this app. 

I found myself guiding her through each task and wondered whether my words affected her thoughts. I tried to stay neutral and straightforward as possible without manipulating the conversation but I can see my explanations may hinder the process. I think this has a lot to be with my own preparation — I could have been clearer and more explicit when explaining the app and UT tasks since it felt like I was showing her the functions of the app or justifying the usability problems to her. Next time, I could try asking questions that invoke the user’s opinions/thoughts.

Overall, I think doing more usability tests would make me more comfortable with interacting with participants/strangers in a professional setting. Making longer conversations at the beginning would help in building trust with the participant. It’s best to properly prepare as much as possible beforehand to minimize unexpected occurrences/situations but still be flexible and adaptable.
