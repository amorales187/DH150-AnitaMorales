# DH150 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing by Anita Morales
## Introduction

**LA County Library** is the largest library system in California and serves communities along its 86 branches. They created a website to promote their resources and services. On the website, patrons can use the catalog to find books and can also manage their check outs through the website. The LA County Library offers several e-resources, such as Mango and Kanopy, that provides patrons with access of information and learning from home. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing (UT)
The purpose of a usability test is to test and improve how easy a user interface is to use and navigate. With UT Testing, designers are able to identify specific problems and expand results from a heuristic evaulation. Further, UT Tests allow designers to determine how effective, efficient, and satisfactory a product is to the users. 

## Methodology

In this UT session, I used Apowersoft Online Screen Recorder to record my user interview in a quiet room. I went ahead and interviewed my mom since she fit my target audience; middle age woman between the ages of 45-60. The entire process took about 35 minutes. 

This User Test focused on testing three heaurstitics in order to design three different tasks. Each tasks measured the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product for the user. 

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Aesthetic and minimalist design | Cluttered and overwhelming homepage | Find an online resource (BrainFuse)  | 
Match between system and real world   | List of closest libraries are not listed after search | Locate a local branch (La Puente) |
Flexibility and efficiency of use | Catalog iso verwhelming and lacks flexibility  | Find a book in the catalog |

**Process of the Usability Test:**
* Introduction
* Informed Consent
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* (3) Task Scenarios 
* Post-Test Questionnaire
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

## Reflection

**What I Learned**

I learned about more problems that I oversaw when I completed the Heurstic Evaluation for the LA County Library website. For example, I observed that new pages would open when my particpant would access the catalog or online resources. I also discovered that the website had more problems with its consistency and standards in regards to its menu and functions. I also learned more about ways on how to improve my survey (e.g. how to better word questions and what other questions to add).

**What Went Well**

At first, I was concerned that the UT set up would overwhelm my participant, but she caught on quick and followed my directions. She was able to catch on to more problems on the website that my initial Heuristic EValuation did not find. She also provided me with another perspective of how she would use the website. 

**What Did Not Go Well**

I discovered that UT recording did not record any sound. My whole recording only captured the screen recording. 

**Things to Improve**

Many times I wanted to ask follow up questions to get my participant to share what she was observing on the screen. For example, based on her facial expressions and reactions, I would notice that she would see the website open new web pages and she did not like that. I also would like to improve holding back any non verbal communication that would signal I am approving my participants actions. I would sometimes find myself wanting to nod my head in agreeance when my partipant found something annoying. Most importantly, I will test new programs I use to ensure they record and capture sound.
