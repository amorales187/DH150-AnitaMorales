## ðŸ—º Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. Eva's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Eva is using this product
> Eva is using the LA County Library's online cataloge to search, find, and check-out books for her children. With the temporary closures of all LA County Library branches, she and her family are no longer able to visit the library and look through the collection to find a new book to read. Instead, the library offers Side Walk Serive at their libraries. Patrons can place items on hold through their cataloge and pick up their items when they are ready. 


#### How Eva is using this product
> After work, Eva goes on the LA County Library website using her laptop. She calls over her kids so they could look through the catalog together. When they are on the home page, they have a difficult time finding the catalog. Not even the Teen & Kids tab had a catalog for the kids. They finally see a search bar drop down when clicking on "Show Search" in the middle of the header on the home page.
