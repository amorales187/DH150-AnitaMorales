# Creating an Accessible Library Website
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
### Anita Morales | DH-150 | Fall 2020

Project Description:

Designing a new and accessible website for libraries in the midst of a pandemic is significant in continuing to help patrons. Many are sheltering at home and institutions, such as libraries, remain closed to the public and;therefore, are forced to redesign their services. With services going online, the digital divide is apparent. It makes it more difficult when a library's websites are difficult to navigate and overwhelming to use. Focusing on the two major library systems in Los Angeles, I will be evaulating both Los Angeles Public Library and LA County Library's website in order to design a more simple and easy to use website for middle-age patron who indentify as female.

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)  
Rating  | Importance  |
:---: | :---  |
1  | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
2  | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  |
3  | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority  |

## Website 1: [LA County Library](https://lacountylibrary.org/)

The LA County Library is one of the largest library systems in the United States. It contains a total of 86 library branches that are spread throughout Los Angeles County and it serves about 3.4 million residents. Their website is full of resources, services, and information that is targeted for all ages and backgrounds.

###Evaluation


Heuristic & Description |  Severity Rating | Improvement 
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------
**Visibility of system status:** The web/app gives the user feedback in a timely manner concerning the actions they are currently doing. | **2:** When user signs up for the newletter throught the forum, they get redirected to the homepage. The user has to scroll down to confirm if their information was correctly submitted and collected | **Improvement:** Provide the user with an explicit confirmation message (either through a pop-up or re-direct them to a confirmation page) about successfully joining the newsletter.
**Match between system and real world:** Design and icons are based off of general knowledge. Things the user will easily recognize. | **Bad:** The graph at the bottom is not necessarily reflective of grades, not as easily recognizable. Within calendar there is a funnel, which has an unclear meaning - it means other classes. Three dots in calendar takes you to settings and that goes to a setting of notification time. | **Improvement:** The graph could be changed to an A+ symbol. The funnel could be a plus (indicating for more) or three dots. The notification time setting can be better, since there is only one option in settings, to have a different icon of a bell is better for notifications.
**User control and freedom:** User has options, such as undo or redo. | **Bad:** In notifications, there is a list of notifications that have been sent by instructor to the class through CCLE. I have multiple messages but there is no back button. Three dots at the top do not have a back button. | **Improvement:** Place a back button option at the top in addition to the three dot icon.
**Consistency and standards:** Design and usage is consistent across all pages of the web/app. | **Bad:** Some drop down menus are not the same style: check in circle; smaller, dark circle in larger one; square vs circle. In each course there are options at the top for Contents, Grades, and Competencies. Competencies is empty and the meaning of it is unknown. | **Improvement:** Have a uniform drop down menu style and select option. Have a description on pages where there is no information or titles can be ambiguous. 
**Error prevention:** Provide safety nets for user, such as confirming an action. | **Good:** There is a save button for when submitting assignments. | **No Improvements:** There seem to be enough precautions in place that will prevent the user from making any detrimental actions that cannot be undone.
**Recognition rather than recall:** Provide suggestions or context in actions. | **Bad:** Search courses, doesnâ€™t search your courses but searches for other courses. | **Improvement:** Either describe what the search function is for or change the search function to be searching within your courses. 
**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Make a page that is accessible to all, have basic functions at the forefront and more advanced options accessible through more steps. |**Good:** General settings and then more advanced, less used ones separate, such as synching. **Bad:** Sometimes there is extra navigation involved that does not require it, there is only one option in each navigation step. | **Improvement:** Depending on how many options in each setting step, reduce the amount of steps to get to the end option.
**Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Design is not cluttered and easily accessible. | **Bad:** The large colored bars for each class at the home page are not needed. They clutter the page and make it so you have to scroll more. | **Improvement:** Take away the colored blocks and just have separate, distinct boxes for each course.
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Have a non-concerning message about an error and give information on how to fix it of move forward. | **Bad:** Error notifications have to be manually put on, through a 4 step process. | **Improvement:** Have error notifications be set automatically. The user can manually turn them off if that is their choice.
**Help and documentation:** Have easily accessible and understandable help pages or pages with commonly asked questions. | **Bad:** Help takes you to an outside page, out of the app. The help seems to be more catered to administrators, rather than users. No search for help. No FAQ, common issues. No Trouble shooting. Help does not reflect the app or how it looks. | **Improvement:** Have a help that is centered for users within the app and one that reflects the app that is in use. An FAQ of troubleshooting option in the app would also be helpful.
