# Creating an Accessible Library Website
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation '
### Anita Morales | DH-150 | Fall 2020

Project Description:

Designing a new and accessible website for libraries in the midst of a pandemic is significant in continuing to help patrons. Many are sheltering at home and institutions, such as libraries, remain closed to the public and;therefore, are forced to redesign their services. With services going online, the digital divide is apparent. It makes it more difficult when a library's websites are difficult to navigate and overwhelming to use. Focusing on the two major library systems in Los Angeles, I will be evaulating both Los Angeles Public Library and LA County Library's website in order to design a more simple and easy to use website for middle-age patron who indentify as female.

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
